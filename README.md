## Purpose
I am following the directions of "The Ray Tracer Challenge" by Jamis Buck for this repositiory. My goal is to understand graphics programming better. The book is language-agnostic, and I will be using Rust to write the ray tracer.

## Current Understand of Graphics Programming Before Starting
I have had around 400~ hours of exposure to a variety of different programming languages, but not too much into the specifics of graphics programming. I have made a triangle using WGPU (a Rust graphics library) a couple times now. The main thing I know about graphics programming is its main usage of linear algebra, for which I have not taken any classes for at this time.

## Goal
Complete the book and create my first ray tracer, while trying to absorb the mathematical concepts that are being talked about, but not necessarily taught.
